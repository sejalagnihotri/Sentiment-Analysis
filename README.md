### Detailed description:
- Sentiment analysis of YouTube videos as well as Live speech was
accomplished. The aim was to predict emotion out of a spectrum of 5
emotions. In this project we implemented Ensemble method of Vector
Space Model (VSM)(Implemented from a research paper) and LSTM. Also,
we designed Web-App to fulfill the aim of building an end to end
application.
